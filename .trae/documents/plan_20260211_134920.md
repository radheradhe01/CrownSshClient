# Show Individual VM Terminal Output

The current implementation mixes terminal output from all selected VMs into a single stream. I will implement a tabbed terminal interface to allow viewing output for each VM individually.

## 1. Store Enhancements
- Update [vmStore.ts](file:///Users/bhaveshvarma/Pictures/SSH_client/src/store/vmStore.ts) to include `activeTerminalVmId`.
- Implement logic to automatically select the first VM as active when selections are made.
- Ensure the active terminal switches if the currently viewed VM is deselected.

## 2. Terminal UI Refactor
- Modify [CommandExecutor.tsx](file:///Users/bhaveshvarma/Pictures/SSH_client/src/components/CommandExecutor.tsx) to include a "Terminal Selector" bar.
- This bar will show tabs for each selected VM, including their current execution status (color-coded indicators).
- Filter the log display to only show output from the `activeTerminalVmId` or system-level messages.

## 3. Improved Log Management
- Ensure logs are still collected for all VMs in the background, but only the focused one is rendered to the user.
- Add a "Clear All Logs" and "Clear Current Log" option for better control.

## 4. Technical Steps
1. **Modify `VMState`** in [vmStore.ts](file:///Users/bhaveshvarma/Pictures/SSH_client/src/store/vmStore.ts) to manage `activeTerminalVmId`.
2. **Update `toggleVMSelection`** logic to maintain the active terminal state.
3. **Refactor the `logs.map` loop** in [CommandExecutor.tsx](file:///Users/bhaveshvarma/Pictures/SSH_client/src/components/CommandExecutor.tsx) with a filter: `logs.filter(log => log.vmId === activeTerminalVmId || log.vmId === 'system')`.
4. **Add the Tab UI** using Tailwind CSS to match the existing dark theme.
