I will address the reported issues with the following plan:

1. **Fix "Run" Button Disappearing**: In `CommandExecutor.tsx`, I will constrain the width of the terminal title (`h2`) using `min-w-0` and `truncate`. This prevents the title from pushing the "Run" button off-screen or shrinking it when a VM with a long name is selected (which happens automatically on "Select All").

2. **Fix "Select All" / "None" Buttons**: I will re-verify `VMList.tsx` to ensure the old "Select All" and "None" text buttons are completely removed. The user's report suggests they might still be visible or the new toggle isn't behaving as expected. I will verify the logic `allSelected ? deselectAll : selectAll`.

3. **Fix "Can still see VMs" & Race Conditions**:

   * In `vmStore.ts`, I will refine the `AbortController` logic. Currently, it aborts *any* ongoing fetch. I will change it to **only abort if starting a new Page 1 load (environment switch)**. This prevents the "Infinite Scroll" (Page 2) request from accidentally canceling the "Initial Load" (Page 1) request, which would leave the user with an empty or incomplete list.

4. **Verification**: I will review the file contents to ensure all changes are applied correctly.
